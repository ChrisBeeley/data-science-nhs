<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>As discussed in an earlier chapter, section 12 of the NHS service standards compels those who follow it to “Make new source code open”. Elsewhere, the NHS is being enjoined to use (as well as produce) open source software (REF). Using free software sounds like an obvious thing for a public sector body to do, and open sourcing its own code and allowing other bodies to make use of it also sounds on the surface like a sensible approach. It’s important first to understand what the words “free” and “open” actually mean.</p>
<p>Open source software licences are not well understood within the NHS, and the important distinction between copyright and licensing even less so. This chapter will cover what free and open source software is, discuss why software licensing is so important, cover the most commonly used software licences, and explain the crucial distinction between holding the copyright for a body of code and having a licence to modify and distribute it.</p>
</div>
<div id="free-and-open" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> “Free” and “open”</h2>
<p>The words <em>free</em> and <em>open</em> both have everyday meanings in English, and the word <em>free</em> is perhaps doubly confusing since it can refer to something that is either provided without cost (“free as in beer”) or without restriction (“free as in speech”). Confusion often arises because much of free and open source software is both free of cost and provided without restriction. However, when organisations like the Free Software Foundation (FSF) use the word free:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer” (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, being able to charge money for copies of source code is part of the meaning of “free” within the definition of free software given by the Free Software Foundation (Ibid.).</p>
<p>The word <em>open</em> is sometimes used to mean “visible”, and sometimes in a more restrictive meaning of “free and open source”. Merely releasing code, for example on a website, and making it visible, gives nobody else the right to use, modify or distribute it. In order to avoid this confusion, truly free and open source software is often designated as such- Free and Open Source, often abbreviated to FOSS. The remainder of this chapter will focus on FOSS. Even the meaning of FOSS can be controversial, since there is some disagreement about how “free” different software licences are. It is standard practice to take the list of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">FOSS licences maintained by the FSF</a> and the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) as being the canonical list of free licences.</p>
</div>
<div id="free-and-open-source-software" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Free and open source software</h2>
<p>Before considering some of the common licences it is worth understanding the different perspectives of the FSF and the OSI and how they affect for what kinds of licence they typically advocate for. The FSF was founded by Richard Stallman (RMS) who became convinced of the need for software freedom through a number of incidents that occurred when he worked at MIT’s AI laboratory in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>The most famous example of these incidents relates to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html">a modification that RMS had made to a printer in use at the lab</a>. He had modified the printer software so that it would email everyone waiting for print jobs when it jammed, so that they could go and unjam it and prevent a backlog of printing from forming after a jam. When the printer was replaced with a newer version RMS found that the source code was not provided (as it had been with the first printer); moreover when he requested the source from someone who had worked on the printer he was told that it was not available. RMS was therefore unable to modify the new printer software to send emails after a jam as he had done previously. This and other incidents of this kind convinced RMS of the need to protect what he went on to call the “four freedoms” of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non technical readers may be confused as to the designation of the first freedom as freedom 0. This is a slightly whimsical extension of the custom in most programming languages (C, for example, or Java, but not R) to begin numbering elements of an array at “0” rather than “1”.</p>
<p>Any licence that meets these conditions is considered by the FSF to be free. However, the FSF prefers licences which are “copyleft”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft</a>, which is a distorion of the word “copyright”, is a form of licensing which allows a work to be reused, adapted, and distributed, but forces individuals who make use of that right to give the same rights to any derivative works they produce . Copyleft is therefore a form of licensing which protects the rights of all of the users who use derivative works. The most famous example of a copyleft licence is the GPL, more on which later.</p>
<p>Copyleft can be contrasted with “permissive” licences, which give similar rights to reuse, modify, and distribute, but do not mandate that individuals exercising those rights give the same rights over derivative works. There is some debate as to which of these types of licences is the most “free”. The FSF argue that since permissive licences allow others to take away your rights over source code, that they are less free. Others (such as the OSI) <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#copyleft">state no preference between copyleft and permissive licences</a> and recommend both approaches depending on the project. Still others argue that since permissive licences make fewer demands of individuals reusing and modifying code they are freer than copyleft licences. This debate echoes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Freedom">Erich Fromm’s classic distinction</a> between “freedom from” (freedom from having your rights over source code taken away) and “freedom to” (freedom to reuse and modify code without sharing the derivative work).</p>
<p>It is not necessary for this argument to be settled here- for the current purpose it is enough to understand what copyleft licences (like the GPL) do and what permissive licences (such at the MIT licence) do and to make sure that data science teams in the NHS are able to choose the licence that is best for their individual project.</p>

<div id="licences" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Licences</h2>
<div id="permissive" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Permissive</h3>
<p>The most famous examples of permissive licences are the MIT and BSD licences. These licences allow reuse and modification but, unlike copyleft licences, also allow the code to be incorporated into a proprietary codebase without making that codebase subject to the terms of the original licence.</p>
<div id="mit" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.1</span> MIT</h4>
<p>The <a href="(https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/#)">MIT licence</a> is one of the shortest and simplest licences, and reads as follows:</p>
<p>MIT License</p>
<p>Copyright (c) [year] [fullname]</p>
<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is

<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all

</blockquote>
<p>This licence shows all the typical features of an open source licence very clearly- it gives permission to others to use, copy, and modify the source, it ensures that the copyright and permission notice is displayed in any modified software, and it includes a notice indicating that the software is provided without warranty of any kind.</p>
</div>
<div id="apache-2.0" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.2</span> Apache 2.0</h4>
<p>The apache licence is quite a similar permissive licence. It is quite a lot longer than the MIT licence, in the main because it spells out more legal terms which are left implicit in the MIT licence. The main important difference is that it places more obligations on individuals ditributing the code or modified versions to include materials from the original codebase. Specifically, it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
this License; and</li>
<li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files; and</li>
<li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distrib-
ute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Deriva-
tive Works; and</li>
<li>If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribu-
tion notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever
such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your
own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or
as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such addi-
tional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As can be seen, this adds to the licence conditions of the MIT licence by forcing distributors of code to state changes that have been made, as well as to include the contennts of any NOTICE file from the original codebase.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-licences" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.3</span> Other licences</h4>
<p>Although there are many other permissive licences, in the interest of brevity they will not be discussed further here. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">This is a very comprehensive list of licences (with some commentary from the perspecitve of the FSF)</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="copyleft" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Copyleft</h3>
<p>Copyleft licences, as described previously, are quite different to permissive licences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>impose substantial limitations on those who create and
distribute derivative works based on works that use these licenses. The GNU Gen-
eral Public License (the GPL License) explicitly requires that derivative works be dis-
tributed under the terms of the GPL License and also that derivative works may only
be permitted to be distributed under the terms of the license. The Mozilla License
imposes different and less restrictive terms on the licensing of derivative works</p>
