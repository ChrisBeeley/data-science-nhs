It is mandatory for certain digital services within government but the latest guidance includes standards which can be adopted across the public sector regardless of whether they would require mandatory assessment. It includes fourteen standards. This document examines these standards from the point of view of data science teams, and particularly data science teams within the NHS. The NHS service standard reproduces the 14 standards, and provides extra information to teams in the NHS in recognition of some of the ways that the NHS can differ from other areas of the public sector. The NHS service standard also includes 3 extra service standards, again recognising the unique environment of the NHS. Examples of the difference between working within the NHS and the rest of the public sector include: multi-disciplinary teams are not common in the NHS - by “multi-disciplinary” we mean teams made up of product and delivery managers, designers, developers, user researchers and content designers NHS delivery teams are less likely to be practising user-centred design and agile service delivery measuring outcomes is often more complex for health more products and services are commissioned locally, for example in hospital trusts, and they are more likely to rely on suppliers, long-term contracts and “off the shelf” solutions These issues are clearly equally important in data science, particularly the last point, and I propose in this document that data science teams across the NHS begin to work more closely in line with the GOV.UK service standard, as expressed within the NHS digital service standard and including the extra three points on it. The fourteen GOV.UK points area listed following, followed by the three extra NHS points. Understand users and their needs in the context of health and care Work towards solving a whole problem for users Provide a joined up experience across all channels Make the service simple to use Make sure everyone can use the service Create a team that includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives Use agile ways of working Iterate and improve frequently Respect and protect users’ confidentiality and privacy Define what success looks like and be open about how your service is performing Choose the right tools and technology Make new source code open Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns Operate a reliable service Support a culture of care Make your service clinically safe Make your service interoperable "],

Following is an outline of the types of skills one would expect to find within a data science team. From the data job family data engineer and data scientist are the key roles. An effective data science team would ordinarily be expected to include individuals with skills in these areas. The other skillsets in this family are data analyst and performance analyst. Data analysts and analysts are an important adjunct to an effective data science team but will not necessarily be part of the team itself. Data analysts: &quot;apply tools and techniques for data analysis and data visualisation (including the use of business information tools) identify, collect and migrate data to and from a range of systems manage, clean, abstract and aggregate data alongside a range of analytical studies on that data manipulate and link different data sets summarise and present data and conclusions in the most appropriate format for users&quot; Performance analysts: &gt;…develop performance measurement frameworks - key performance indicators (KPIs), goals, user needs and benefits - and analyse the performance of a service or product against these, adapting your approach and framework appropriately and in line with any changes The synergy with these roles and those of an effective data science team should be clear. Data and performance analysts take metrics and methodologies that have been developed and productionised by the data science team (as well as preexisting data reports) and deliver them across the organisation They make use of dashboards, regular and ad hoc reports and ensure that these measures are used and understood throughout the organisation. For the purposes of this discussion it is enough to say that the difference between the two roles is one of emphasis- with data analysts focused on bringing stakeholders new information and insight from across the organisation and performance analysts on ensuring that performance targets are met and liaising with teams and senior managers when they find that performance is not being met in a particular area. For a fuller discussion of these roles see this discussion of the data job family. It should be clear, therefore, that the work of data scientists can only be brought effectively to bear on an organisation when used in conjunction with data and performance analyst skills. Effective data science teams which do not include these skills, therefore, (which some will), should have a close and mutually supportive relationship with a team which does. It is worth noting that all of these skills do not have to be within one individual in the data science team, and nor does each skill have to be found in only one member of the team. Effective teams can have individuals who have a broad skillset fulfilling several of these roles and/ or “specialists” who are highly experienced within a narrow domain and fulfil this role only in the team. 2.3 Agile Agile methods are widely used in data science and they are extremely helpful in making sure that the analyses and data products that are used meet user specifications as well as ensure that they are thoroughly tested in a live context before deployment. The key message from agile methods is that: iterative, user-centred ways of working will help you get your service in front of real users as soon as possible. Then observing and analysing data on how they use it, and iterating the service based on what you’ve learned. Because you’re not specifying everything up front before you’ve developed an understanding of what users need, you will reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing Following on from the points made previously about multidisciplinary working it is worth noting that Agile Data Science states that agile data science teams favour: Choosing generalists over specialists Preferring small teams over large teams There are eleven different job roles listed within Agile Data Science, and the author argues that having these roles fulfilled by individuals whose skill spans two or three of these roles can contribute to the agility of a team and reduce the overheads that large, specialised teams can suffer from, such as the need for each role to effectively communicate with other similar roles (e.g experience designer, interaction designer, and web developer). NHS service standard number 6 (multidisciplinary teams) explicitly states that teams must “includes people with expertise in how services are delivered across all the relevant channels, and the back end systems the service will need to integrate with”. To make such a team small and agile, it is often preferable for individuals to span several roles, some spanning front end activities (data scientists with experience in UX and web design) and some back end activities (data scientists who can do some or all of their own data engineering). Agile methods are covered in more detail in chapter 3. 2.4 Respect and protect users’ confidentiality and privacy This point is clearly highly germane in healthcare, and it’s worth noting that the rapid prototyping and lack of career specialisation inherent in much of data science do increase the risks that mistakes will be made with user data. This part of the service standard lists many obligations, including: actively identify security and privacy threats to the service and have a robust, proportionate approach to securing information and managing fraud risks have a plan and budget that lets you manage security during the life of the service (for example, by responding to new threats, putting controls in place and applying security patches to software) work with business and information risk teams (for example, senior information risk owners and information asset owners) to make sure the service meets security requirements and regulations without putting delivery at risk carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing Early data science work (for example dashboards which do not contain identifiable data, delivered within an organisation’s firewall) may not require strict adherence to these guidelines, but the danger is that as the scope of a programme of work widens these issues become relevant and the data science team do not take the appropriate steps to ensure that they bring on board security and governance specialists who can ensure that data is processed and delivered to endusers securely. 2.5 Make new source code open Although the advantages of using open source technologies and of open sourcing new technologies have been known for decades (see, e.g. The Cathedral and the Bazaar), and government policy has encouraged the production and use of open source within the public sector for ten years or more there has been surprisingly little progress in this area. The NHS is still overwhelmingly dependent on expensive, proprietary software, giving rise to vendor lock in as well as wasting public money. Anecdotal reports suggest even that many IT departments are reluctant to install the statistical programming language R, an absurd situation given its widespread adoption and use across industry and academia. At the same time, NHS organisations are still very reluctant to open source any code produced by their staff or by agencies subcontracted by NHS organisations. Open sourcing new code is important enough to warrant its own chapter (see chapter 4), for the present time it will suffice to quote from the NHS service standard: “Public services are built with public money. So unless there’s a good reason not to, the code they’re based should be made available for other people to reuse and build on. Open source code can save teams duplicating effort and help them build better services faster. And publishing source code under an open licence means that you’re less likely to get locked in to working with a single supplier” "],

["open-source-chapter.html", "4 Open source 4.1 Introduction 4.2 “Free” and “open” 4.3 Free and open source software 4.4 Licences 4.5 NHS data science and software licences", " 4 Open source 4.1 Introduction As discussed in an earlier chapter, section 12 of the NHS service standards compels those who follow it to “Make new source code open”. Elsewhere, the NHS is being enjoined to use (as well as produce) open source software (REF). Using free software sounds like an obvious thing for a public sector body to do, and open sourcing its own code and allowing other bodies to make use of it also sounds on the surface like a sensible approach. It’s important first to understand what the words “free” and “open” actually mean. Open source software licences are not well understood within the NHS, and the important distinction between copyright and licensing even less so. This chapter will cover what free and open source software is, discuss why software licensing is so important, cover the most commonly used software licences, and explain the crucial distinction between holding the copyright for a body of code and having a licence to modify and distribute it. 4.2 “Free” and “open” The words free and open both have everyday meanings in English, and the word free is perhaps doubly confusing since it can refer to something that is either provided without cost (“free as in beer”) or without restriction (“free as in speech”). Confusion often arises because much of free and open source software is both free of cost and provided without restriction. However, when organisations like the Free Software Foundation (FSF) use the word free: …you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer” (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) Indeed, being able to charge money for copies of source code is part of the meaning of “free” within the definition of free software given by the Free Software Foundation (Ibid.). The word open is sometimes used to mean “visible”, and sometimes in a more restrictive meaning of “free and open source”. Merely releasing code, for example on a website, and making it visible, gives nobody else the right to use, modify or distribute it. In order to avoid this confusion, truly free and open source software is often designated as such- Free and Open Source, often abbreviated to FOSS. The remainder of this chapter will focus on FOSS. Even the meaning of FOSS can be controversial, since there is some disagreement about how “free” different software licences are. It is standard practice to take the list of FOSS licences maintained by the FSF and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as being the canonical list of free licences. 4.3 Free and open source software Before considering some of the common licences it is worth understanding the different perspectives of the FSF and the OSI and how they affect for what kinds of licence they typically advocate for. The FSF was founded by Richard Stallman (RMS) who became convinced of the need for software freedom through a number of incidents that occurred when he worked at MIT’s AI laboratory in the 70s and 80s. The most famous example of these incidents relates to a modification that RMS had made to a printer in use at the lab. He had modified the printer software so that it would email everyone waiting for print jobs when it jammed, so that they could go and unjam it and prevent a backlog of printing from forming after a jam. When the printer was replaced with a newer version RMS found that the source code was not provided (as it had been with the first printer); moreover when he requested the source from someone who had worked on the printer he was told that it was not available. RMS was therefore unable to modify the new printer software to send emails after a jam as he had done previously. This and other incidents of this kind convinced RMS of the need to protect what he went on to call the “four freedoms” of software: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. Non technical readers may be confused as to the designation of the first freedom as freedom 0. This is a slightly whimsical extension of the custom in most programming languages (C, for example, or Java, but not R) to begin numbering elements of an array at “0” rather than “1”. Any licence that meets these conditions is considered by the FSF to be free. However, the FSF prefers licences which are “copyleft”. Copyleft, which is a distorion of the word “copyright”, is a form of licensing which allows a work to be reused, adapted, and distributed, but forces individuals who make use of that right to give the same rights to any derivative works they produce . Copyleft is therefore a form of licensing which protects the rights of all of the users who use derivative works. The most famous example of a copyleft licence is the GPL, more on which later. Copyleft can be contrasted with “permissive” licences, which give similar rights to reuse, modify, and distribute, but do not mandate that individuals exercising those rights give the same rights over derivative works. There is some debate as to which of these types of licences is the most “free”. The FSF argue that since permissive licences allow others to take away your rights over source code, that they are less free. Others (such as the OSI) state no preference between copyleft and permissive licences and recommend both approaches depending on the project. Still others argue that since permissive licences make fewer demands of individuals reusing and modifying code they are freer than copyleft licences. This debate echoes Erich Fromm’s classic distinction between “freedom from” (freedom from having your rights over source code taken away) and “freedom to” (freedom to reuse and modify code without sharing the derivative work). It is not necessary for this argument to be settled here- for the current purpose it is enough to understand what copyleft licences (like the GPL) do and what permissive licences (such at the MIT licence) do and to make sure that data science teams in the NHS are able to choose the licence that is best for their individual project. 4.4 Licences 4.4.1 Permissive The most famous examples of permissive licences are the MIT and BSD licences. These licences allow reuse and modification but, unlike copyleft licences, also allow the code to be incorporated into a proprietary codebase without making that codebase subject to the terms of the original licence. 4.4.1.1 MIT The MIT licence is one of the shortest and simplest licences, and reads as follows: MIT License Copyright (c) [year] [fullname] Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. This licence shows all the typical features of an open source licence very clearly- it gives permission to others to use, copy, and modify the source, it ensures that the copyright and permission notice is displayed in any modified software, and it includes a notice indicating that the software is provided without warranty of any kind. 4.4.1.2 Apache 2.0 The apache licence is quite a similar permissive licence. It is quite a lot longer than the MIT licence, in the main because it spells out more legal terms which are left implicit in the MIT licence. The main important difference is that it places more obligations on individuals ditributing the code or modified versions to include materials from the original codebase. Specifically, it states: You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distrib- ute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Deriva- tive Works; and If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribu- tion notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such addi- tional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. As can be seen, this adds to the licence conditions of the MIT licence by forcing distributors of code to state changes that have been made, as well as to include the contennts of any NOTICE file from the original codebase. 4.4.1.3 Other licences Although there are many other permissive licences, in the interest of brevity they will not be discussed further here. This is a very comprehensive list of licences (with some commentary from the perspecitve of the FSF). 4.4.2 Copyleft Copyleft licences, as described previously, are quite different to permissive licences. They: impose substantial limitations on those who create and distribute derivative works based on works that use these licenses. The GNU General Public License (the GPL License) explicitly requires that derivative works be distributed under the terms of the GPL License and also that derivative works may only be permitted to be distributed under the terms of the license. The Mozilla License imposes different and less restrictive terms on the licensing of derivative works. (Laurent 2008) Copyleft licences therefore frequently find a use when the publishers of open source code want to make sure that the code in them is not relicensed and incorporated into a proprietary system. There is no prohibition on what the code is used for, or whether the distributors charge a fee, as long as the distributor of the code is prepared to open source all of the code in the derivative work, not just the piece originally licensed under the GPL. Quite obviously it is therefore extremely unpopular companies and individuals who are in the business of selling proprietary code. It is important to note that the GPL comes into effect whenever the code is distributed in some way- for example on a CD or as a download from the Internet. This distinction will become important later in this section. 4.4.2.1 GPL The GPL (general public licence) is the cornerstone of the philosophy of the FSF, and it enshrines the four freedoms described previously. Many of the key projects championed by the FSF (such as the GNU Emacs editor and the GNU C Compiler, as well as the Linux Kernel) are licensed under the GPL. The licence begins with a nice summary of its terms: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The GPL, as can be seen, in this introductory section, lays out three important principles of the GPL- firstly, that it is designed to protect software freedom, including of derivative works. Secondly, any type of warranty is disavowed. Lastly, an explicit condition that patents arising from this code must themselves be licensed under the GPL. The FSF has strong views on software patents which are made very clear in this section- they state their view that software patents should not be able to restrict the freedom of software, but where they are, this licence prevents them from doing so. The GPL goes on to give clearer guidance on the exact terms of the licence. For the sake of brevity it will not be discussed further here. Interested parties are directed to the link given above or for explanation on the terms to Laurent (2008). 4.4.2.2 AGPL The AGPL (Affero General Public Licence) 1is more strongly copyleft than the GPL. Its status among the free software community is somewhat controversial, with some individuals bitterly opposed to it. The most important difference between the GPL and the AGPL is that the AGPL defines “distribution of code” (which, it should be remembered, is the point at which the provisions of the GPL come into force) as allowing a piece of software to be transmitted over a network. It is quite common in recent time for software companies to provide what is called “Software as a Service” (SaaS). An example would be Google Sheets which is a spreadsheet program delivered through a web browser. The user does not have to download any extra code to use it and therefore Google does not have to distribute the code. Software licensed under the GPL can therefore be provided as SaaS without any of the provisions of the GPL applying. The AGPL, therefore, exists to allow code to be licensed so as to ensure that even if it is provided as SaaS the entity making the provision is forced to release all of the modified code under the terms of the GPL. 4.4.2.3 LGPL The LGPL (lesser general public licence) is so called because it “because it does Less to protect the user’s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.” The LGPL is designed for software libraries rather than full applications. A library (for the benefit of non technical readers) is a computer program that is used in the service of another computer program. For example, a piece of software that plays music might incorporate several different libraries to decode different music formats (such as MP3, FLAC, or AAC). The FSF recommend the LGPL (or rather, did recommend it) in cases where there were already proprietary libraries that can be swapped in for free ones. For example, there was a free version of the C compiler (non technical readers should just not worry what this is- suffice to say that it’s pretty important to make a Linux machine work) but licensing it under the GPL would have discouraged creators of proprietary software from using it. Their response would be simply to use a proprietary compiler, which would decrease the reach of free software and would not benefit the free software community in any way. The LGPL allows a piece of software to make use of the code in a library without making all of its source code open. It therefore preserves the free software library by making it a viable choice, even if it doesn’t make other software that uses it free (source). To understand where the LGPL does and does not allow the use of LGPL code in a proprietary product the FSF distinguish “works based on the library” and “works that use the library”. Works that use the library can be incorporated within a proprietary product. What this means in practice is slightly fuzzy in practice but usually this means that a body of code will communicate with the library using some sort of standardised interface (e.g. sending some sort of stream of data in a particular way) and receive back something that itself is standardised in some way (for example, music that has been decoded). The library itself is being used for its intended purpose and is not substantially modified. Works that are based on the library will usually be works that reimplement or modify the actual library itself, changing the code and making it do something different or making it work in a different way. Under the LGPL works that do this have to release all of their code exactly as though the code was licensed by the GPL (Ibid). 4.4.2.4 Mozilla public licence The Mozilla public licence (MPL) is like the LGPL except more weakly copyleft. Both allow the possibility over incorporating code released under their licence conditions to be used with a proprietary codebase. As we have seen, the LGPL places fairly clear restrictions on this reuse, which effectively prevent distributors of the code from modifying the original code in any way. By contrast, the MPL allows modified code to be incorporated into a proprietary codebase as long as the modifications are themselves shared, but not the rest of the code which they are distributed with. 4.5 NHS data science and software licences The best software licence for a data science project will vary case by case, but there are some broad things to consider when choosing one. The most important decision to make is between permissive and copyleft licences. Permissive licences are useful to maximise the impact of something in situations where there is no concern about what proprietary vendors might do with code. Releasing code under, for example, an MIT licence allows everybody, including individuals using proprietary code, a chance to use the code under that licence. Using a copyleft licence is useful when there is concern about what proprietary vendors might do with a piece of code. For example, vendors could use some functionality from an open source project to make their own product more appealing, and then use that functionality to sell their product to more customers, and then use that market leverage to help them acquire vendor lock in. Vendor lock in is the state in which using a company’s prodcuts ensures that you find it very difficult to move to another company’s products. An example might be using a proprietary statistical software package and saving data in its proprietary format, making it difficult to transfer that data to another piece of software. If proprietary software companies can use code to make the world worse in this way, then choosing a copyleft licence is an excellent way of sharing your code without allowing anybody to incorporate it into a proprietary codebase. Proprietary software companies are free to use copyleft licensed code, but are highly unlikely to do so since it means releasing all of the code that incorporates it. "],
["copyright-chapter.html", "5 Copyright and intellectual property 5.1 Intellectual property 5.2 Crown copyright", " 5 Copyright and intellectual property 5.1 Intellectual property Intellectual property is an umbrella term which principally refers to copyright, trademarking, design rights, and patents. Trademarks and design rights, although they can sometimes be relevant in the world of software development (for example, in the story of the Debian linux distribution rebranding Firefox to Iceweasel) are only obliquely related to the present matters of discussion and will not be explored any further here. Under the Berne convention, copyright is assigned automatically to any expression (such as a piece of music, a book, an artwork, or a set of computer code). It is not necessary to apply for copyright. Where a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, or a film, is made by an employee in the course of her employment (“work for hire”), her employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work (unless they agree otherwise). The expression “in the course of employment” is not well defined but the crucial difference is between “contract of service” (eg as an employee) and “contract for services” (eg as a freelancer). Individuals working under a contract of service will usually maintain copyright (unless they agree otherwise). Patents are a very different thing, and give intellectual property over an idea. Some argue that software patents should not exist at all and there is much debate about where the boundaries should be between ideas in software that can and cannot be patented (for example in the case of non-obviousness). The ideas and debates in this area are very important and interesting in the world of software but given the reservations many free software proponents have about software patents (and the complexity and expense of acquiring and defending software patents) they are clearly not a suitable thing for NHS data science teams to acquire and will not be discussed further here. Copyright, on the other hand, cannot be avoided since, as discussed above, it is automatically attributed at the moment of creation to the individual creator(s) or their employing organisation. Failing to discuss this issue at the beginning of a project could lead to confusion and disagreement once a project has begun or been completed. In a sense the holder of copyright for a piece of software licensed as FOSS (whether permissively or as copyleft) is unimportant, since the software licence ensures that anybody can use the code for any purpose (subject to the restrictions of copyleft where this is applied). However, one important power that a copyright holder has on a piece of open source software is the ability to relicense. Relicensing takes place when copyright holders wish to take existing code and place it under another licence. There is a great deal of confusion about exactly how to ensure that code can be relicensed legally, but there are examples of where this has been done successfully here, here, and here. In short, it is widely believed that in order to relicense computer code it is necessary to get the approval of all, or nearly all, of the contributors. Some projects, such as the Linux kernel, have thousands of contributors and are therefore widely seen as impossible to relicense. Where only one individual or organisation holds the copyright relicensing is simple. The FSF ensures that the copyright of all of their software projects is explicitly granted to them by all contributors so they can responsibly exercise the powers that being a copyright holder grants. 5.2 Crown copyright The data scientists at the Government Digital Service have no need to concern themselves with copyright in their day to day work since All code produced by civil servants is automatically covered by Crown Copyright Source. The NHS, by contrast, because is a patchwork of national and local bodies (NHS England, Nottingham City CCG, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust…), can potentially produce code that is copyright to any one of hundreds of different organisations. When these bodies cooperate they could produce code licensed to a confusing patchwork of different organisations. Individuals working for the NHS should be able to cooperate on open source projects without engaging in lengthy negotiations about which organisations will hold copyright and, furthermore, it is desirable that individuals in other NHS organisations can freely contribute without worrying about whether their employer expects to see their “share” of the intellectual property. A solution to this problem would be for there to be a presumption that NHS staff releasing open source code do so under a Crown copyright licence, unless there is a reason why an exception to this rule should be made. There is precedent for assigning copyright to the crown but assigning it routinely to open source code produced by NHS staff has not been tried previously. "],
